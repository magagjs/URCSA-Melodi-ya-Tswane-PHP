									<p>The <abbr title="Christian Women’s Ministry">CWM</abbr> is well represented in the Church Council by 7 members. Some of our members 
										are preachers, liturgists, interpreters, ward leaders, choir members and a Sunday school principal. We are also responsible for

									<p>We are one of the fortunate <abbr title="Uniting Reformed Church in Southern Africa">URCSA</abbr> congregations to be blessed

															<li>The two pockets on the jacket are an indication that Christian women are not supposed to harm others, but should

																Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is

															woman the emphasis is always on inward adornment. The uniform is thus a symbol of simplicity, minimalism, plainness and unfussiness as well as
